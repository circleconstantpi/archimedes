## Archimedes Measurement of a Circle

The famous polymath Archimedes showed in his "Circvli Dimensio" how the circle number Pi can be calculated. His inequalities are very unfriendly, when it comes to implementing them in a computer algorithm.

In a first step, I analyzed his work, drew my conclusions from it and then developed possible algorithms from his inequalities. This is an interesting experience.

I will gradually publish the results on Archimedes and others here. There will be well-known and less well-known things. Later, I will present my more modern findings on Pi here and make them available to the interested public.

Once SageMath is installed, interested visitors can try out the Jupyter notebooks for themselves. Prerequisite is the installation of SageMath and basic knowledge of Python.
