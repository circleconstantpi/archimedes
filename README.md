Archimedes Measurement of a Circle

The famous polymath Archimedes showed in his Circvli Dimensio how the circle number pi can be calculated. His inequalities are unfriendly in terms of implementation in a computer algorithm. 

In the first step, I analyzed his work, drew my conclusions and then developed possible algorithms from his inequalities.
