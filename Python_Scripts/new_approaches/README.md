In this section two types of Python scripts are introduced. In general <code>Python3</code> is used. One type of Python scripts is using <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> numbers in conjunction with the standard Python module <code>math</code> which consist e.g. of a square root algorithm. The other type of Python scripts is using the standard Python module code>decimal</code> and the related number types.

When using the <code>float</code> number type the places after the decimal point are limited to 15-17 places. This is a significant restriction. Using the standard Python module <code>decimal</code> and the related number types one can deal with nearly an infinite number of places. 

The Archimedean approch for the calculation of Pi is used together with more or less well known approaches e.g. from Snellius, DÃ¶rrie and Aitken for a better approximation of Pi. 

I have found a new approach to improving convergence for which I have not yet been able to find a reference or another source. A detailed mathematical proof is still pending.

Precision and number of iterations give an idea of the quality of the algorithm. To make such a comparison more transparent I am using the same number of places of Pi and compare them with the calculated result.
